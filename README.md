# Polychrome

Polychrome adds a sidebar with tabs and groups to the left of your browser window. 

Now that Chrome is able to unload background tabs on its own, having many, many tabs becomes worthwhile — and the tab strip is woefully unprepared.

Polychrome lets you more carefully curate, group, and archive your tabs, building a familiar structure and giving you quick access to the things you need.

## Usage:

1. Open chrome://extensions
2. Turn on Developer mode
3. Drag the root directory of this repository in.
4. Pin the toolbar button
5. Open it and pop out the window
